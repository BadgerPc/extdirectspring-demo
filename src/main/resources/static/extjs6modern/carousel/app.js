/**
 * Our app is pretty simple - it just grabs the latest images from NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day 
 * (http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) and displays them in a Carousel. This file drives most of
 * the application, but there's also:
 * 
 * * A Store - app/store/Pictures.js - that fetches the data from the APOD RSS feed
 * * A Model - app/model/Picture.js - that represents a single image from the feed
 * * A View - app/view/Picture.js - that displays each image
 * 
 * Our application's launch function is called automatically when everything is loaded.
